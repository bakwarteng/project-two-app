# Happy Tails

## Description

Happy Tails is a website designed for animal lovers who are interested in adopting cats and dogs. The website features a homepage where users can view available cats and dogs for adoption, along with their basic information such as breed, age, and gender. Users can click on their preferred animal to view more detailed information about them, including breed info and personality traits. When ready to adopt, users can click the "adopt now" button, which prompts them to log in or sign up for an account.
